// TermifierWindowControllerCloseGroupsTests.swift
// TermifierTests
//
// Covers the group-close batch entry points on `TermifierWindowController`
// (Termifier/Views/MainWindow/TermifierWindowController.swift):
// `closeGroups(relativeTo:mode:)` (the shared entry, resolving
// `GroupCloseMode` against `windowSession.groups` order, used by the
// group context menu's `.others`/`.below` and by the single-group paths
// `closeActiveGroup()`/`closeAllTabsInGroup(id:)` via `.this`) and
// `closeGroups(_:)` (closes every tab of every given group through one
// batch). Also covers the delegation of the EXISTING `closeActiveGroup()`
// (via the public `closeGroup(_:)` action) and `closeAllTabsInGroup(id:)`
// onto that same batch path.
//
// `ThreeGroupFixture` (`TermifierTests/GroupControllerFixture.swift`): A
// (tabs [a0, a1], active a0, the window's active group), B (tabs
// [b0, b1, b2], active b0), C (tab [c0], active c0), groups in order
// [A, B, C].
//
// Every expected `groups`/`activeGroupID`/`activeTabID` value below was
// computed BY HAND from `WindowSession.removeGroup(id:)`'s own rule
// (emptying a group removes it; if it was the active group, the
// neighbour at the same index -- or the last group if that index no
// longer exists -- becomes active) and `TabGroup.removeTab(id:)`'s own
// rule (removing the active tab promotes the survivor at the same
// index, or the last remaining tab if none), applied once per victim
// tab in the order `closeGroups(_:)` closes them: group by group, in
// the order the victim groups were given, tabs within a group in their
// existing order -- NOT by running the implementation and reading back
// its output.
//
// The activation count is read through the DEBUG-only test seam
// `_activateCurrentTabCountForTesting`, as a DELTA: captured immediately
// before the call under test and compared after, since controller
// construction may or may not itself call `activateCurrentTab()`.
