//
//  AgentRowPaneTitleTests.swift
//  TermifierTests
//
//  Regression pin for the Agents sidebar row's primary label sourcing
//  each pane's OWN recorded title (SurfacePropertyStore.title(for:))
//  rather than the owning tab's title. TermifierWindowController's
//  handleSetTitleNotification writes tab.title only for the ACTIVE
//  tab's FOCUSED split leaf, so a per-tab title source collapses two
//  agent panes split inside one tab to a single shared row label.
//  Exercises the real mechanism end to end: a real SurfacePropertyStore
//  fed by a real NotificationCenter.default.post(.ghosttySetTitle, ...)
//  and the real AgentRowDisplay.primaryLabel(title:), with no stub or
//  fake standing in for either.
//
//  Coverage:
//  - two distinct surfaces posting two distinct titles resolve to two
//    distinct SurfacePropertyStore.title(for:) results -- the case a
//    per-tab title source would collapse to one shared value
//  - the same pair rendered through AgentRowDisplay.primaryLabel still
//    differ, and each equals its own posted title verbatim
//  - a surface that never posted a title resolves to "N/A" rather than
//    borrowing a sibling surface's recorded title
//  - a later title update to one surface leaves a different, already-
//    tracked surface's recorded title untouched
//  - a bridged herdr row (.external source, focusSurfaceID set) composes
//    its label through focusSurfaceID, not its own surfaceID -- the
//    herdr pane id itself never resolves to a title in the store
//  - an unbridged herdr row (.external source, no focusSurfaceID) has no
//    resolvable focus target and composes to "N/A"
//  - a native (.hooks) row with no focusSurfaceID composes its label
//    through its own surfaceID
//  - a .titleHeuristic-shaped row (AgentEntry.cwd nil, as every
//    .titleHeuristic entry's is) resolves its cwd line through the
//    pane's own SurfacePropertyStore-recorded pwd, fed here by a real
//    NotificationCenter.default.post(.ghosttySetPwd, ...), rather than
//    falling back to "N/A"
