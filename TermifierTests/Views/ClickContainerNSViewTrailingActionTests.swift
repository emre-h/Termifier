// ClickContainerNSViewTrailingActionTests.swift
// TermifierTests
//
// Covers `ClickContainerNSView.trailingAction(at:)` and the trailing-action
// branch of `mouseDown(with:)` (Termifier/Views/TabBar/TabClickRecognizer.swift).
// `trailingActions` generalizes the existing close-button rect mechanism to
// an ordered list of AppKit-hit-tested rects, used by the sidebar group
// header's collapse chevron and close-all glyph (both visual-only images,
// no SwiftUI Button) so a Ctrl+click on them reaches this view's context
// menu dispatch instead of being swallowed by a Button.
//
// The view is flipped (`isFlipped == true`): local y grows downward. A
// `TrailingAction` rect is `size` square, vertically centered in `bounds`,
// with `insetFromTrailing` points between its trailing edge and
// `bounds.maxX`. For the 200x36 view used below, an action with
// `insetFromTrailing: 14, size: 20` occupies x in [166, 186], y in [8, 28].
