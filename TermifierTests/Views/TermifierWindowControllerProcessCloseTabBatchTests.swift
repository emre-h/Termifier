// TermifierWindowControllerProcessCloseTabBatchTests.swift
// TermifierTests
//
// Covers `TermifierWindowController.processCloseTab(tab:group:mode:)` for
// `GHOSTTY_ACTION_CLOSE_TAB_MODE_OTHER`/`_RIGHT`: both close their
// victims through one batch, `closeTabs(_:in:)` (not `private`, so this
// file can exercise it directly for the group-emptying cases below),
// which deactivates the current tab at most once, tears down every
// victim, removes them from the group, then activates the current tab at
// most once. `activateCurrentTab()` runs exactly once when the window's
// active tab was among the victims or `windowSession.activeGroupID`
// changed as a result of the close, and not at all otherwise. `THIS` is
// unaffected: it always closes only the target via the single-tab
// `closeTab(id:)` path.
//
// When the victims are every tab of `group`, `WindowSession.removeTab`
// removes the now-empty group; if no group is left, the window closes
// via `closeLastWindow()` (`isClosingForShutdown = true`, then
// `window?.close()`); otherwise, if the emptied group was the window's
// active group, `activeGroupID` is reassigned to the group now at the
// emptied group's index, or the last group if that index no longer
// exists. If the emptied group was NOT the active group, `activeGroupID`
// is left unchanged.
//
// The activation count is read through the DEBUG-only test seam
// `_activateCurrentTabCountForTesting` (incremented at the top of
// `activateCurrentTab()`), as a DELTA: captured immediately before
// `processCloseTab`/`closeTabs(_:in:)` and compared after, since
// controller construction may or may not itself call
// `activateCurrentTab()`.
//
// Every expected `tabs`/`activeTabID` value below was computed BY HAND
// from `TabGroup.removeTab(id:)`'s own rule ("if the removed tab was
// active: the tab now at the same index, else the last remaining tab"),
// applied once per victim in the order `closeTabs(_:in:)` closes them
// (`OTHER`: every other tab in original tab-bar order; `RIGHT`: tabs
// positioned after the target, in original tab-bar order) -- NOT by
// running the implementation and reading back its output.
