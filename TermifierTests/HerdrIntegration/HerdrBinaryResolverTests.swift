//
//  HerdrBinaryResolverTests.swift
//  TermifierTests
//
//  Covers HerdrBinaryResolver: resolving the optional,
//  user-installed `herdr` binary. Unlike SessionBinaryResolverTests
//  (termifier-session is a bundled resource), every tier here depends on
//  either an injected environment or an injected candidate list --
//  NONE of these tests may depend on this machine's real PATH or real
//  install locations, both because that would be nondeterministic
//  across dev machines/CI, and because own manual smoke test
//  `brew install`s herdr onto this exact development machine, which
//  would silently flip any test relying on real defaults from red to
//  green (or vice versa) the day that happens.
//
//  Coverage:
//  - TERMIFIER_HERDR_BIN env override wins over PATH and known candidates
//    simultaneously, verbatim, without an existence check
//  - An empty (but present) TERMIFIER_HERDR_BIN falls through to the next
//    tier, mirroring SessionBinaryResolver's own !isEmpty handling
//  - PATH scan finds an executable `herdr` in a single injected PATH
//    directory
//  - PATH scan skips a NON-executable `herdr` in an earlier PATH
//    directory and finds the executable one in a later directory --
//    pins FileManager.isExecutableFile specifically, not a
//    fileExists-only check
//  - PATH wins over known candidates when both have a valid match
//  - Known-candidate fallback is used when PATH has no match
//  - All three tiers missing resolves to nil
//  - A miss (nil) is never permanently cached: once herdr appears on
//    disk after an earlier miss, the next resolve() call on the SAME
//    instance finds it -- installed-after-launch detection
//  - A FOUND path stays memoized across subsequent calls even if later
//    removed from disk -- only a miss re-scans, never a hit
//  - Two resolver instances constructed with different environments
//    resolve independently (no global/static memoization leak)
