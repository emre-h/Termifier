//
//  HerdrTabCoordinatorTests.swift
//  TermifierTests
//
//  Covers HerdrTabCoordinator: centerpiece, owning
//  "open a herdr workspace as a native Termifier tab" plus live layout sync.
//  Every side-effectful dependency is injected (transportFactory,
//  surfaceFactory, attacher, registry, sleep) so this file never opens a
//  real socket or touches a real ghostty surface -- mirrors
//  HerdrIntegrationCoordinatorTests' own driving style (spy transport
//  factory, simulateLine, yield-based settling), adapted for a
//  one-shot-request-only wire flow (layout.export) instead of that
//  file's connect/subscribe pair.
//
//  OPEN DERIVATION CHOICE -- RESOLVED (was disclosed-but-unpinned; now
//  MEASURED against live herdr 0.8.0, protocol 19, and pinned exactly):
//  openWorkspace(workspaceID:socketPath:) is given only a bare workspace
//  id, but herdr's layout.export takes "pane_id" or "tab_id" in params,
//  never "workspace_id". A bare "<workspaceID>:t1" STRING DERIVATION
//  (this file's own prior implementation) is WRONG -- the workspace's
//  actual ACTIVE tab id must be resolved via a one-shot `workspace.get`
//  (params EXACTLY {"workspace_id": ...} -- WorkspaceTarget's own schema
//  shape, `herdr api schema --json`) FIRST, then used VERBATIM as
//  layout.export's own "tab_id" (never "pane_id") -- see
//  `driveOpenSequence` below, and
//  `test_openWorkspace_activeTabIDFromWorkspaceGet_notDerivedFromWorkspaceIDString_usedExactlyForLayoutExport`
//  for the test that specifically kills the string-derivation (a
//  deliberately non-"<workspaceID>:t1"-shaped active_tab_id, "wF:t3").
//  `driveLayoutExport` (the OLDER, narrower helper) is now used ONLY by
//  handleLayoutUpdated's own refresh-path tests below -- that method's
//  own tab-id sourcing is DELIBERATELY left unpinned (its
//  own tests' contract is unchanged): the correction covered here fixes
//  openWorkspace only. Whether handleLayoutUpdated should also route
//  through workspace.get (or instead thread the
//  already-resolved tab id through from the open) is still open.
//
//  Coverage:
//  - openWorkspace: single-pane happy path -- one workspace.get, one
//    session.snapshot resolving each wire pane id to its own terminal
//    id, one layout.export scoped to workspace.get's own active_tab_id,
//    one surface whose command is EXACTLY HerdrAttachBridgeCommand's own
//    output (built from the RESOLVED terminal id, never the pane id),
//    registered, attachTab called with a leaf-root plan
//  - openWorkspace: split happy path -- two surfaces created in wire
//    (first-then-second) order, a .horizontal split plan at the wire's
//    own ratio, focusedLeafID resolved from focused_pane_id (the SECOND
//    pane, deliberately, to catch a "always the first leaf" bug)
//  - openWorkspace: the active_tab_id workspace.get returns is used
//    VERBATIM as layout.export's own "tab_id" -- even when it does NOT
//    match the "<workspaceID>:t1" shape a string-derivation would
//    produce; this is the test that kills the string-derivation
//  - openWorkspace: second createSurface fails -> the first surface is
//    rolled back, nothing stays registered, attachTab never called
//  - openWorkspace: an invalid wire pane id -> zero surfaces created at
//    all (the bridge command's own nil is treated as total failure
//    BEFORE any createSurface call, never discovered only afterward)
//  - openWorkspace: a wire pane id absent from session.snapshot's own
//    terminal-id map -> the identical total-failure discipline as an
//    invalid wire pane id: zero surfaces created, zero registrations, no
//    attachTab call
//  - openWorkspace: an already-attached workspace (focusExistingTab
//    returns true) -> zero transport activity, zero surfaces, no
//    attachTab call
//  - openWorkspace: workspace.get's own transport failing before it ever
//    answers -> failure, zero surfaces, attachTab never called, and
//    neither session.snapshot nor layout.export is ever even attempted
//  - openWorkspace: workspace.get itself answering with an RPC error ->
//    same failure discipline
//  - openWorkspace: layout.export's own transport failing before it ever
//    answers, AFTER a successful workspace.get AND session.snapshot ->
//    same failure discipline
//  - handleLayoutUpdated: a re-export identical to what's already known
//    (same tree, same ratio) -> never calls the ratio-mutation seam
//  - handleLayoutUpdated: a re-export with ONLY a ratio change -> calls
//    the ratio-mutation seam exactly once, mapped to the REAL,
//    already-tracked leaf UUIDs (via the registry's paneID lookup), not
//    fresh import-time UUIDs
//  - handlePaneClosed: asks the attacher to close the tracked leaf,
//    prunes the registry in BOTH directions, and NEVER sends any request
//    to herdr (every transport's own sent lines stay byte-for-byte
//    unchanged)
//  - .termifierSurfaceDestroyed (a Termifier-side close): prunes the registry via
//    HerdrPaneRegistry's own existing observation mechanism, never calls
//    closeLeaf again, and sends no herdr request either
//  - handleWorkspaceKilled (the Session Browser's Kill action, called
//    after herdr already closed the workspace server-side): closes
//    every leaf still registered for that workspace through the same
//    close path handlePaneClosed uses, prunes the identical bookkeeping
//    once the last one closes, and sends no herdr request either
//  - handleWorkspaceKilled: a workspace with nothing registered (never
//    opened in this window, or already fully closed) is a no-op
//  - HerdrWorkspaceInfo decode: a minimal, required-fields-only payload
//    decodes both active_tab_id and label; the title-selection decision
//    itself (label present vs. absent/null/blank) is covered directly by
//    HerdrTabTitlePolicyTests, not here -- this file only pins that
//    workspace.get's own response feeds the coordinator a real label
//    (test_openWorkspace_singlePane_..., plan.title, "demo" fixture)
//  - adoptRestoredTab: populates the identical activeTabIDs/
//    remainingPaneIDs bookkeeping openWorkspace's own tail populates, so
//    handleWorkspaceKilled/handlePaneClosed close an ADOPTED leaf exactly
//    like an OPENED one, hasOpenTab answers true, and the call sends
//    herdr nothing; a second call for the same (workspaceID, socketPath)
//    is a complete no-op, proven by an extra pane the second call alone
//    carries never being tracked
