//  HerdrIntegrationCoordinatorTests.swift
//  TermifierTests
//
//  HerdrIntegrationCoordinator's CONNECT SEQUENCE ordering (a one-shot
//  `session.snapshot` on its OWN transport, applied to the mirror and
//  used to build the per-pane subscribe list, BEFORE a SEPARATE
//  `events.subscribe` transport is ever opened), pane-set REBUILD
//  triggers (including the anti-storm dedup against a (re)subscribe's
//  own replay burst), the PER-STEP handshake deadline, and EOF/failure
//  DISCONNECT HANDLING with a reconnect budget bounded across cycles.
//  See HerdrIntegrationCoordinator.swift's own header for the full
//  frozen contract, and HerdrConnection.swift's own header for the
//  measured wire facts this coordinator is built from.
//
//  Every test here is driven the way production is: presence reporting
//  a herdr session live (`herdrSessionPresenceDidChange(.appeared(...))`)
//  is the ONLY thing that starts a connection. The presence CONTRACT
//  itself -- which transition does what -- is pinned separately, in
//  HerdrIntegrationCoordinatorPresenceTests.swift.
//
//  Every dependency is a fake/spy -- no real socket is ever opened.
//  `SpyHerdrTransportFactory` hands out a fresh `InMemoryHerdrTransport`
//  per `makeTransport()` call, retaining each so tests can drive/inspect
//  it. `HerdrAgentMirror` and `AgentRegistry` are used as REAL, freshly-
//  constructed instances (never mocked) -- registry state is this file's
//  way of confirming the coordinator's snapshot/event/connectionLost
//  calls actually reached the mirror.
//
//  TRANSPORT ACCOUNTING: unlike the type this coordinator used to depend
//  on (one persistent, multiplexed connection per connect attempt), EVERY
//  successful connect attempt now opens exactly TWO transports -- an
//  even-indexed one-shot `session.snapshot` connection (which always
//  closes itself once answered) immediately followed by an odd-indexed,
//  long-lived `events.subscribe` connection (the only one any test ever
//  injects further events onto). `driveConnectAttempt(coordinator:
//  factory:baseIndex:paneIDs:)` below drives exactly one such pair and
//  is the base every call-count assertion in this file is built from --
//  never hand-rolled per test.
//
//  Coverage:
//  - never observing a presence change -> zero factory calls, no
//    background timer
//  - a session appearing: a one-shot session.snapshot (its own
//    transport) completes BEFORE a separate events.subscribe transport
//    is ever opened; the fetched snapshot is applied to the mirror; the
//    subscribe's own per-pane list is exactly what that snapshot
//    revealed, alongside the six structure events (including
//    "workspace.closed")
//  - the already-connected session appearing again opens no second
//    connection
//  - a session appearing at ANOTHER socket path after the bound one was
//    given up on is connected to: the reconnect budget bounds one
//    server, not this coordinator's whole life
//  - a paneCreated event for a genuinely NEW pane rebuilds the connection
//    (a fresh snapshot + a fresh subscribe transport), and the rebuilt
//    subscribe list includes that new pane
//  - a paneCreated event for an ALREADY-known pane does NOT rebuild
//    (anti-storm: the (re)subscribe's own replay burst must not self-trigger)
//  - "pane_closed"/"pane_exited" events always rebuild unconditionally,
//    regardless of what is currently known
//  - a rebuild's own subscribe list is derived from THAT rebuild's OWN
//    fresh snapshot (never from separately-mutated bookkeeping) -- a
//    closed pane is excluded because the fresh snapshot no longer reveals
//    it, not because of any special-cased removal step; the superseded
//    event-stream transport is explicitly closed
//  - a paneAgentStatusChanged event reaches the mirror end-to-end
//  - EOF calls mirror.connectionLost(), then reconnects (a fresh 2-transport
//    connect attempt) while the socket still probes alive
//  - EOF stops entirely (no retry) once the socket no longer probes alive
//  - Reconnect budget: bounded ACROSS cycles (not just within
//    one), surviving a reconnect that completes its own connect sequence
//    and then drops again before any event is ever pushed
//  - Handshake deadline, per step: a snapshot that hangs forever times out and gives up
//    plainly (no subscribe transport ever created), closing its own
//    transport (BLOCKER-analog: proof the stuck step is actually
//    unstuck, not merely abandoned) -- and a later presence transition
//    still connects fresh afterward; a subscribe that hangs forever
//    times out the same way
//
//  NOTE ON XCTAssert + actor-isolated values: `XCTAssertEqual`/etc. take
//  `@autoclosure` (non-async) parameters, so `await factory.callCount`
//  cannot be written directly inside one -- every such check below
//  resolves it to a local `let` first, then asserts on the local.
