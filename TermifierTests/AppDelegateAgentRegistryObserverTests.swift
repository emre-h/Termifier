//
//  AppDelegateAgentRegistryObserverTests.swift
//  TermifierTests
//
//  `.ghosttyCommandFinished` and `.termifierSurfaceDestroyed` both name a
//  surface and mutate the app-wide `AgentRegistry` singleton, so their
//  observers belong on `AppDelegate`, which lives for the app's lifetime,
//  not on `TermifierWindowController`. A window-scoped observer drops both
//  signals whenever every main window is closed and only the QuickTerminal
//  is open -- an ordinary state on macOS, where closing the last window
//  does not terminate the app -- and neither signal repeats, so a drop is
//  permanent.
//
//  Each test below runs in two phases, and the first phase is what keeps
//  this file honest: it posts the notification BEFORE registering this
//  delegate's observers and asserts nothing happened. That phase fails if
//  any other live object in the test process still relays the notification
//  into `AgentRegistry.shared` -- which is exactly what moving these
//  observers back into `TermifierWindowController` would reintroduce, since
//  around sixty fixtures across `TermifierTests` build real controllers whose
//  `init` registers observers on `NotificationCenter.default`.
//
//  How far the `.ghosttyCommandFinished` test can reach: its handler
//  resolves the surface ID through `surfaceView.surfaceController?.id`,
//  and `GhosttySurfaceController` has exactly one initializer, which
//  requires a live `ghostty_app_t` -- the same wall
//  `GhosttyActionCommandFinishedTests`' own header documents on the
//  posting side of this notification. No unit test can hand the handler a
//  non-nil `surfaceController`, so the final
//  `AgentRegistry.handleGhosttyCommandFinished` call is NOT pinned here.
//  What IS pinned is everything ahead of it: that the post reaches an
//  app-scoped observer with no window controller in existence, and gets as
//  far as resolving the surface. `ReadCountingSurfaceView` below counts
//  that resolution. The `.termifierSurfaceDestroyed` handler needs no surface
//  controller (its payload is a bare `UUID`), so that one is pinned all
//  the way into `AgentRegistry`.
