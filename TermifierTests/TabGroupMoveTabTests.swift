//
//  Missing observer:
//  `TabGroup.moveTab(fromIndex:by:)` is `GHOSTTY_ACTION_MOVE_TAB`'s intended
//  pure-logic core (via `TermifierWindowController.processMoveTab(tab:group:
//  amount:)`) but is currently an intentional no-op stub (see its own doc
//  comment in TabGroup.swift), so every test below that expects `group.tabs`
//  to actually reorder fails.
//
//  Semantics (confirmed by reading `ghostty/src/input/Binding.zig`'s
//  `move_tab` doc comment directly, not inferred): moving a tab WRAPS
//  cyclically at the ends, it does not clamp. `newIndex` for a move of
//  `amount` starting at `fromIndex` in a `count`-tab group is the
//  mathematical (never-negative) modulus `((fromIndex + amount) % count +
//  count) % count` -- Swift's own `%` returns a NEGATIVE result for a
//  negative left operand (e.g. `-5 % 3 == -2`, not `1`), so a correct
//  implementation needs that `+ count` renormalization step, not a bare
//  `%`. Several tests below exist specifically to catch an implementation
//  that skips it.
//
//  Every "no-op" test (amount 0, amount == count, count == 1, out-of-range
//  fromIndex) is, against TODAY's empty stub, a currently-vacuous pass --
//  the stub does nothing for EVERY input, so "nothing changed" trivially
//  holds regardless of whether the guard the test is meant to verify
//  actually exists. They stay in this suite as regression guards for the
//  real implementation (e.g. a missing `fromIndex` bounds check would crash
//  via `tabs.remove(at:)` rather than merely misbehave).
