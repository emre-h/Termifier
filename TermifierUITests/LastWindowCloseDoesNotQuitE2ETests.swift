// LastWindowCloseDoesNotQuitE2ETests.swift
// TermifierUITests
//
// End-to-end coverage for the window-lifetime redesign: closing Termifier's
// LAST window (the red button) no longer quits the app at all, matching
// Ghostty's own behavior. This file used to cover the OPPOSITE, now-
// removed behavior (closing the last window routed through
// `TermifierWindowController.windowShouldClose`, which called the real
// `AppDelegate.confirmQuitIfNeeded()` -- a genuine `NSAlert.runModal()`
// -- and, once confirmed, quit the app for real; see git history for
// that version if the old rationale is ever needed again). That whole
// path is gone: `windowShouldClose`'s override was deleted entirely (so
// AppKit's own default -- always allow the close, no confirmation --
// applies), and `AppDelegate.applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed`
// now always returns `false`. This file is rewritten from scratch to
// verify the NEW contract instead of the deleted one.
//
// THIS FILE COVERS (all three, as one sequential round trip, mirroring
// this directory's established one-scenario-per-file style, e.g.
// `SessionPersistenceE2ETests`):
//   1. Closing the app's only window via its red close button shows NO
//      confirm-quit dialog (that confirmation was removed from every
//      close path; only Cmd+Q / the "Quit Termifier" menu item keep theirs
//      -- unchanged, and NOT this file's concern).
//   2. The app process is still running afterward (with zero windows
//      open), not terminated.
//   3. From that zero-window state, the user can still open a new
//      window (File > New Window, Cmd+N) and keep working.
//
// THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER:
//   - Session persistence / restore-on-relaunch. That is
//     `SessionPersistenceE2ETests`'s job (quitting via the "Quit Termifier"
//     menu item, which still exists and still saves/restores exactly as
//     before) -- duplicating that coverage here, for a close path that
//     no longer even terminates the app, would test nothing new.
//   - Whether a persistent-session pane's daemon-side session is killed
//     vs. detached when the last window closes this way (a production
//     policy decision this task's brief made, but not one of the three
//     points requested for this file's rewrite).
//   - Cmd+Q / "Quit Termifier" menu confirm-quit dialog itself: unchanged,
//     and every other E2E suite in this directory already launches
//     with `--uitesting`, which short-circuits it anyway (see e.g.
//     `SessionPersistenceE2ETests.quitAppViaMenu()`'s own doc comment).
//   - The Dock-icon "reopen" path (`AppDelegate
//     .applicationShouldHandleReopen`), a SEPARATE new entry point
//     (also part of this redesign) from the one this file exercises
//     (File > New Window / `createNewWindow()`). XCUITest can drive a
//     literal Dock-icon click (`XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier:
//     "com.apple.dock")`), but no suite in this directory does so
//     today, and it is unrelated to the specific "the app still
//     responds and can still create windows" property point 3 asks
//     for -- File > New Window proves that property through an
//     already-established, reliable menu-driven mechanism instead. See
//     this suite's handoff notes for this gap.
//
// WHY THE BUSY-PANE STEP (`sleep 300`) IS KEPT, EVEN THOUGH THE OLD
// CONFIRM-QUIT GATE IS GONE: a deliberately long-running foreground
// command, pasted into the pane and left running (never awaited)
// before closing, is what used to force ghostty's `needsConfirmQuit()`
// true and reliably trigger the OLD dialog (see this suite's git
// history for the full investigation into ghostty's
// `cursorIsAtPrompt()`/shell-integration timing). Keeping it here makes
// point 1's "no dialog" assertion meaningful rather than vacuous: an
// idle pane alone would also show no dialog under a PARTIAL regression
// that reintroduced a `needsConfirmQuit()`-conditioned check on this
// path (an idle shell's `needsConfirmQuit()` is false regardless, so
// that hypothetical bug would slip through an idle-only test). Uses
// `panePasteAndReturn` (`PaneCLIExec.swift`) exactly as before; unlike
// the old version, this suite does NOT enable persistent sessions or
// touch the termifier-session daemon/ledger at all, since none of the three
// points under test need it -- `panePasteAndReturn` works identically
// against an ordinary, non-persistent pane, and dropping the daemon
// machinery (HOME override, `TERMIFIER_SESSION_BIN`, ledger polling)
// removes an entire, unrelated axis of E2E flakiness this rewrite has
// no reason to keep paying for.
