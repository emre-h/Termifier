// AuxiliaryWindowCloseE2ETests.swift
// TermifierUITests
//
// GitHub issue #45 ("Cmd+W doesn't work across all windows"): the one
// negative condition the fix's own unit tests (TermifierTests) CANNOT
// reproduce -- see `NSWindow+TermifierClose.swift`'s header comment for the
// full root-cause writeup, and `AppDelegateFileMenuCloseItemsTests`/
// `TermifierWindowTermifierPerformCloseRoutingTests`/`NSWindowTermifierCloseTests`/
// `TermifierWindowControllerCloseFocusedTargetTests`/
// `TermifierWindowControllerKeyWindowMenuValidationTests` for the structural
// (menu wiring, pure-function target selection, key-window-gated
// validateMenuItem) coverage those files already carry.
//
// `NSApp.keyWindow`/`NSApp.mainWindow` are WindowServer-assigned, not
// settable from inside the app process under test -- an XCTest host
// cannot manufacture a real "key but not main" window (`NSWindow
// +TermifierClose.swift`'s header documents About's own panel as reporting
// `canBecomeMain == false`, which is the production-code premise this
// file exists to exercise end-to-end, NOT a fact this file itself
// re-derives -- XCUITest exposes no API to read an element's key/main
// state directly, so what follows verifies the resulting BEHAVIOR
// through a real menu click + a real keystroke, not the AX-level
// key/main mechanics themselves) without an actual end-to-end run
// driving the real WindowServer. A test that tried to fake this some
// other way -- e.g. calling `makeKey()` on an off-screen panel without
// it ever really taking focus -- would not exercise `-[NSApplication
// targetForAction:]`'s real key-window-chain-then-main-window-fallback
// resolution at all; it would pass for the wrong reason.
//
// This codebase already has a cautionary example of exactly that wrong-
// reason failure mode, one directory over:
// `MenuShortcutsUITests.test_nextTab_isDisabled_whenOnlyOneTab` only
// ever asserts the "Select Next Tab" menu item's OWN `.isEnabled` state
// -- it never presses the real Cmd+Shift+] key combo. That is not an
// oversight so much as unavoidable: the real keystroke never reaches
// that menu item's `validateMenuItem`-gated path at all.
// `AppDelegate.installKeyMonitor`'s local key-event monitor intercepts
// Cmd+Shift+] directly (`AppDelegate.matchKeyEvent`'s `.nextTab` case)
// and calls `wc.selectNextTab(nil)` unconditionally -- no tab-count
// gate of its own -- consuming the event (`return nil`) before AppKit's
// menu key-equivalent dispatch ever sees it. So that menu item's
// enabled/disabled state is, for the real keystroke, dead code.
//
// Cmd+W (plain, no Shift/Option) is confirmed NOT one of the shortcuts
// `AppDelegate.matchKeyEvent` intercepts (read that switch directly,
// not assumed -- it matches Cmd+Shift+P, Cmd+Shift+U, Cmd+Shift+],
// Cmd+Shift+[, Cmd+1...9, and, UI-testing-only, Ctrl+Shift+D; nothing
// on plain "w"). So `app.typeKey("w", modifierFlags: .command)` below
// genuinely round-trips through AppKit's real menu key-equivalent
// dispatch and `-[NSApplication targetForAction:]` resolution, unlike
// Cmd+Shift+] would.
//
// THIS FILE COVERS (one scenario per test, mirroring this directory's
// established style, e.g. `LastWindowCloseDoesNotQuitE2ETests`): for
// each of About / Settings / Session Browser, opened via its own real
// menu item (the ordinary way any of these becomes the frontmost,
// user-focused panel -- About is a real `NSPanel`; Settings and Session
// Browser are plain `NSWindow`s that DO become main the moment they
// become key, but still not the terminal's `TermifierWindowController` --
// see `NSWindow+TermifierClose.swift`'s header for why both cases used to
// fail differently pre-fix), a real Cmd+W keystroke must close ONLY
// that panel and must leave the terminal window's own tab count
// completely unchanged. This file verifies that user-visible CONTRACT;
// it does not (and, per the note above, cannot) directly inspect which
// AX-level key/main state produced it -- that mechanism is what
// `NSWindowTermifierCloseTests`/`TermifierWindowTermifierPerformCloseRoutingTests`/
// `TermifierWindowControllerKeyWindowMenuValidationTests` pin at the unit
// level. The terminal window is fixed at exactly 2 tabs
// (`fixTabCountAtTwo()`) BEFORE any panel opens, specifically so a
// post-Cmd+W tab count of 2 proves the count is UNCHANGED, not merely
// "still more than zero" -- pre-fix, About's own symptom was silently
// closing the terminal's ACTIVE tab out from under the user (2 -> 1),
// which a weaker "at least one tab remains" assertion would not have
// caught.
//
// THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER:
//   - The ClipboardConfirmation sheet's own Cmd+W handling (beeps and
//     does nothing, per `NSWindow.termifierPerformClose(_:)`'s `sheetParent`
//     guard) -- driving a real libghostty clipboard-permission prompt
//     from XCUITest is its own can of worms, unrelated to the
//     About/Settings/Session-Browser key-vs-main root cause this file
//     targets, and no existing E2E suite in this directory drives that
//     prompt today.
//   - QuickTerminal's own Cmd+W path (`QuickTerminalWindow`/
//     `QuickTerminalController`, also touched by this same commit) --
//     a separate, non-`.titled` overlay window with its own hide/show
//     lifecycle rather than an ordinary closable window; out of this
//     task's stated scope (About/Settings/Session Browser only).
//   - The `focusSplit*` known gap `TermifierWindowController
//     .keyWindowGatedActions`'s own doc comment records as an
//     intentionally UNFIXED, lower-severity instance of the same
//     root-cause mechanism -- out of scope for issue #45's fix and
//     this file's job of verifying it.
//
// Uses real key input (`app.typeKey`), never `app.terminate()`
// (SIGTERM bypasses AppKit's close path entirely) -- same discipline
// as `LastWindowCloseDoesNotQuitE2ETests`'s own header note.
//
// About panel locator -- FIELD-VERIFIED, not assumed (a first real run
// was deliberately instrumented with a throwaway `logAllTopLevelElements`
// diagnostic -- enumerating `app.children(matching: .any)` with each
// element's `elementType`/title/identifier -- before committing to any
// predicate; not preserved in this file since it was a one-off
// diagnostic, not lasting coverage, but its finding is inlined below):
// About's own AXTitle was never a viable locator to begin with --
// `orderFrontStandardAboutPanel`'s panel is a private AppKit class this
// codebase does not control, and it turns out to report an EMPTY title
// (confirmed in that diagnostic run: `title=""`). It is not usable as
// an EXCLUSION key either --
// the assumption that the terminal's own title would read back empty
// once `titleVisibility = .hidden` is applied to it (`TermifierWindow
// .setupWindow()`) was checked in that same run and is WRONG: it reads
// back as the shell's current directory ("~"), a live, non-empty,
// AppKit-managed value, not "Termifier" and not "". More importantly,
// About is NOT even an `XCUIElementTypeWindow` in the first place --
// `app.windows.count` stayed at 1 for the panel's entire 5s post-open
// poll window while a screenshot taken at that exact moment showed the
// panel fully rendered on screen. `app.children(matching: .any)`
// enumerated over that same moment showed About as the app's ONE
// `app.dialogs` element instead (`XCUIElementTypeDialog`, private
// runtime identifier "_NS:154" -- itself not a stable identifier to
// key a lookup on, so not used as one below). This matches, and is
// presumably WHY, this exact test target already has an established
// `app.dialogs.firstMatch` idiom for exactly this situation (`BrowserUITests`,
// `BrowserScriptingUITests`, `CommandLogE2ETests`, `CockpitApprovalE2ETests`,
// `LastWindowCloseDoesNotQuitE2ETests`, `MenuShortcutsUITests`) -- those
// are all NSAlert-backed prompts, About is AppKit's own standard panel,
// and both land in the same `.dialog` bucket. `app.dialogs.firstMatch`
// is safe to treat as a stable identity here (unlike a positional
// `app.windows.firstMatch` would have been): the terminal window is
// never itself classified as a dialog, so once About closes,
// `app.dialogs` has nothing left to match -- no other element could
// make `firstMatch` re-resolve to something that still (wrongly)
// "exists". Settings and Session Browser, by contrast, DO have
// field-verified, unambiguous WINDOW titles precedented elsewhere in
// this test target ("Appearance" -- `SettingsWindowE2ETests`;
// "Sessions" -- `SessionBrowserAttachKillE2ETests`), so those two tests
// locate their panel directly by title instead, and never needed this
// investigation.
