// PaneCLIExec.swift
// TermifierUITests
//
// Shared pane-command-injection helpers for the E2E suites added
// alongside SessionPersistenceE2ETests (E2E-1/E2E-2/E2E-3). Mirrors
// `BrowserScriptingUITests.terminalExec`'s already-established
// pattern (a real command run by a live pane, not a `Process` spawned
// by the test runner) rather than inventing a new one; kept here
// instead of promoted onto `TermifierUITestCase` itself or merged into
// `BrowserScriptingUITests`'s own private copy, since both of those
// files are outside this task's assigned scope.
//
// The command itself is never pasted or typed directly. It is written
// (via a throwing `try`, never `try?`, so a write failure surfaces as
// an `XCTFail` instead of a silent no-op and a timeout) to a script
// file under `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` -- the TEST
// RUNNER's own sandboxed container tmp, which the runner process can
// write to (unlike `/tmp`, which the sandboxed runner cannot write to
// -- field-verified: a `try?` write to `/tmp` failed silently there)
// and which the pane's unsandboxed shell can still read by its
// absolute path. Only the short line `sh <scriptPath>` is entered
// into the pane, and it is entered via `app.typeText`, not a paste:
// a paste long/slow enough that it is still being delivered when
// Return arrives lands that Return inside the bracketed paste, so the
// command is never executed (field-verified: even the short `sh
// '<path>'` line, entered as a paste, was swallowed this way on a
// loaded machine). `app.typeText` delivers keystrokes in order with
// no bracketed-paste framing, so Return always arrives after the text
// it terminates.
//
// The typed line carries NO quote character around `<scriptPath>`: a
// typed `'` is delivered by pressing whatever physical key produces
// `'` under the OS's ACTIVE keyboard layout at the moment `typeText`
// runs, not a fixed keycode, so under a non-US layout it is delivered
// as a different character entirely (field-verified: `sh '<path>`
// arrived in the pane as `sh ;Su/Users/...`, and the mangled `sh`
// argument then started an interactive shell instead of running the
// script). The script path is always composed only from
// `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` plus filename characters
// this file itself controls (`termifier-e2e`, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`, `/`),
// so it never needs quoting for spaces or shell metacharacters --
// every path passed to `typePaneScript` below is asserted (via
// `XCTFail`, not `precondition`, so a violation reports as a normal
// test failure rather than aborting the process) to contain only
// `[A-Za-z0-9/._-]` before it is typed, so a future caller can never
// reintroduce the need for quoting without that assertion firing.
//
// Rationale for running a command in a live pane at all, instead of
// spawning `termifier-session` as an out-of-process `Process` from inside
// the test runner: `SessionPersistenceE2ETests.swift`'s header
// comment establishes that the `TermifierUITests` runner is itself
// App-Sandboxed and cannot open a new unix-domain-socket connection to
// the daemon, so a `termifier-session` child spawned directly by the
// runner can never reach it. Routing the same CLI calls through a
// real pane (an already-running, unsandboxed child process of
// Termifier.app) is the same workaround `BrowserScriptingUITests` already
// uses for the `termifier` CLI.
//
// CRITICAL, field-verified constraint (found running this suite, not
// assumed): a command pasted into a pane does NOT inherit Termifier.app's
// own `HOME` override. Ghostty execs every surface's command via
// `login -flp <system-username> ...` (confirmed via `ps aux` on a live
// run), which resets the shell's environment against the REAL system
// user, independent of whatever `HOME` `app.launchEnvironment` set on
// Termifier.app's own process. A bare `termifier-session <subcommand>` typed
// into a pane therefore falls back to resolving `$HOME` fresh inside
// that reset shell -- the developer's REAL home, not this test's
// isolated one -- and silently operates against the real daemon
// instead. `SessionCommandSynthesizer.attachCommand`'s own doc comment
// (Termifier/Features/Sessions/SessionCommandSynthesizer.swift:74-140)
// independently confirms this exact failure mode was already
// field-verified for Termifier's OWN internal session commands, which is
// why that function no longer relies on an env override and instead
// bakes explicit `--runtime-dir`/`--state-dir` flags into the command
// string at Swift level before ghostty ever execs it. Every pane
// command this suite issues MUST do the same -- see
// `termifierSessionRootFlags(homeDir:)` below -- never a bare
// `termifier-session <subcommand>` with no flags.
