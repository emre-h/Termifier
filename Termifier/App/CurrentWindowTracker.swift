// CurrentWindowTracker.swift

//
// This type supplies the LAST of the three tiers `AppDelegate.
// currentWindowController` resolves through -- its own
// `lastKeyWindowController` -- while `CurrentWindowResolver.resolve(
// key:frontMostVisible:lastKey:ordered:)` below implements the full
// three-tier rule as a pure function: the key `TermifierWindowController`
// first, then the front-most member of `NSApp.orderedWindows` that is both
// visible and on the active Space (never-shown, minimized, and off-Space
// windows are all skipped -- a window on another Space cannot take key
// without a Space switch), and only once BOTH of those find nothing (every
// Termifier window is minimized, off-Space, or not yet shown) does tier 3 --
// `lastKey` while still a member of `ordered`, else `ordered.first` --
// decide. `AppDelegate.currentWindowController` calls this resolver
// directly, passing its own already-resolved key/front-most-visible
// candidates and `currentWindowTracker.lastKeyWindowController`; see that
// property's own doc comment for the full three-tier contract as consumed
// in production.
//
// See TermifierTests/App/CurrentWindowTrackerTests.swift for the specced
// contract.
