// NSWindow+TermifierClose.swift
// Termifier
//
// Issue #45: Cmd+W is silently inert on the About panel / Settings /
// Session Browser (any non-`TermifierWindow` panel) and, worse, closes a
// TERMINAL window's active tab out from under the user while one of
// those panels is key.
//
// Root cause: the File menu's only Cmd+W item has a nil target and
// `action: #selector(TermifierWindowController.closeTab(_:))`. AppKit's
// `-[NSApplication targetForAction:]` resolves a nil-target action by
// walking, in order: (1) the KEY window's extended responder chain
// (first responder -> ... -> window -> window delegate -> window
// controller), (2) the MAIN window's extended responder chain, (3)
// NSApp, (4) NSApp's delegate. Step (1) always fails to resolve
// `closeTab(_:)` against a non-`TermifierWindow` panel's own chain (no
// `TermifierWindowController` anywhere in it), so AppKit falls through to
// step (2) — but what step (2) finds next, and therefore the
// user-visible symptom, differs by panel:
//   - About's real `NSPanel` (`AppDelegate.showAboutPanel()`, via
//     `NSApp.orderFrontStandardAboutPanel`) reports `canBecomeMain ==
//     false`, so `NSApp.mainWindow` stays pinned to whichever
//     `TermifierWindow` was main before About opened. Step (2) then hits
//     THAT terminal window's `TermifierWindowController` instead — closing
//     the wrong window's active tab while About, the window the user
//     is actually looking at, does nothing.
//   - Settings (`SettingsWindowController.swift`) and Session Browser
//     (`SessionBrowserWindowController.swift`) are each a plain
//     `NSWindow`, not an `NSPanel` — `canBecomeMain` defaults to
//     `true`, so the panel becomes main itself the moment it becomes
//     key. Step (2) then walks that SAME panel's chain a second time
//     and still finds no `TermifierWindowController`, so the nil-target
//     action resolves to nothing anywhere and AppKit auto-disables the
//     menu item instead — no misrouted close, but no response either.
// Either way the menu item is broken — destructively misrouted for
// About, silently inert for Settings/Session Browser.
//
// Fix: give `NSWindow` ITSELF a method with a stable selector,
// `termifierPerformClose(_:)`. Since every window (a plain `NSWindow`/
// `NSPanel` -- About, Settings, Session Browser -- and this app's own
// `TermifierWindow`/`QuickTerminalWindow` subclasses) can answer this
// selector directly, step (1) above (the KEY window's own chain)
// always resolves it, so resolution never needs to fall through to
// step (2)'s main-window fallback -- structurally eliminating the
// misrouting, not just special-casing About.
//
// This must NOT be `performClose:` overridden on `TermifierWindow`/
// `QuickTerminalWindow`: `TermifierWindowController.processCloseWindow()`
// (the sole receiver of ghostty's `close_window` action, Cmd+Shift+W)
// calls `window?.performClose(nil)` directly, and every subclass must
// keep AppKit's own, unmodified `performClose:` implementation for
// that to keep working.
//
// `@objc` is required for two independent reasons: (1) it is what lets
// `-validateMenuItem:`/`-targetForAction:` resolve this selector via
// the Objective-C runtime at all, and (2) since `NSWindow` lives in
// AppKit (a different module from this extension), only a member that
// dispatches through the Objective-C runtime -- which `@objc` confers
// on any `NSObject` subclass -- can be `override`n by a subclass
// declared in THIS module (`TermifierWindow`/`QuickTerminalWindow`); a
// plain, non-`@objc` Swift extension method on an imported class cannot
// be overridden at all (no vtable slot exists for it outside the
// module that defined the base class).
