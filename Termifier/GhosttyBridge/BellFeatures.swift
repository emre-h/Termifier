/// Mirrors ghostty's `bell-features` config option
/// (`ghostty/src/config/Config.zig`,
/// `pub const BellFeatures = packed struct { system: bool = false; audio:
/// bool = false; attention: bool = true; title: bool = true; border: bool
/// = false }` — field declaration order is bit order, LSB first;
/// confirmed by reading the `ghostty` submodule pinned at
/// 332b2aefc6e72d363aa93ab6ecfc86eeeeb5ed28, the exact commit
/// `GhosttyKit.xcframework`'s headers were built from). Termifier's FFI
/// layer (`GhosttyConfigManager`) has no typed accessor for a
/// packed-bool-struct config value, so this reconstructs ghostty's own
/// bit layout by hand as a Swift `OptionSet`, for the app to decode
/// `bell-features`'s raw integer config value against.
///
/// Each feature's effect (from `Config.zig`'s own doc comment on
/// `bell-features`):
///   - `system`: macOS plays the system alert sound.
///   - `audio`: play a custom sound file (`bell-audio-path`).
///   - `attention` (enabled by default): bounce the dock icon once while
///     unfocused.
///   - `title` (enabled by default): prepend a bell emoji to the alerted
///     surface's title until refocused/interacted with.
///   - `border`: display a border around the alerted surface until
///     refocused/interacted with.

/// Injectable seam for `AppDelegate.processRingBell`'s per-feature side
/// effects, following this codebase's closure-based DI convention (see
/// `TermifierWindowController.recoveryBarModel` and `AppDelegate
/// .approvalBannerModel`'s own closure-injected callbacks) rather than a
/// protocol: each `BellFeatures` bit maps to exactly one independent,
/// parameterless action, so a struct-of-closures needs no additional
/// abstraction. Tests substitute
/// their own recording closures so `processRingBell`'s dispatch is
/// assertable without actually playing a sound (`NSSound.beep()` is
/// unmockable and audibly disruptive under a test run) or bouncing the
/// real dock icon.
///
/// Every closure defaults to a no-op, but `AppDelegate.processRingBell`
/// already dispatches to all five unconditionally, whenever the
/// matching `BellFeatures` bit is set (see that method's own doc
/// comment). `handleRingBellNotification`
/// (`AppDelegate.swift`), the real production call site, wires
/// `performSystemBell`/`performAudioBell`/`requestAttention` to real
/// system effects; `flashTitle`/`flashBorder` are the two left as
/// no-ops there (bell-emoji-in-title and border-flash presentation are
/// out of scope here — see that call site's own doc comment).
