// HerdrAttachOrCreateFlow.swift
// Termifier
//
// SessionBrowserWindowController's own flow for a herdr server row's
// "New" button: sends workspace.create, then opens the workspace that
// creates. Always creates, unconditionally -- there is no decision to
// make here (a workspace row's own "Attach" button opens an already-known
// workspace id directly through HerdrTabCoordinator
// .openWorkspace(workspaceID:socketPath:), never through this file; see
// SessionBrowserWindowController.attachHerdrWorkspace(_:)).
//
// openWorkspace is injected as that SAME HerdrTabCoordinator
// .openWorkspace(workspaceID:socketPath:) entry point: there is exactly
// one place that opens a workspace as a native Termifier tab, and this file
// never reimplements it. Injected (rather than taking a
// HerdrTabCoordinator directly) so this flow is testable with a plain spy
// closure, without constructing a full coordinator -- see
// HerdrAttachOrCreateFlowTests.swift.
//
// @MainActor: openWorkspace's production closure captures a @MainActor
// HerdrTabCoordinator; running this flow off the main actor would force
// that capture across an isolation boundary.
//
// logger is the caller's own Logger value (Logger is a struct) passed
// in, not a second instance declared here, so every failure this file
// logs goes through the exact same logger SessionBrowserWindowController
// already uses for "Failed to open herdr workspace ...". workspace.create
// failing, and the newly created workspace failing to open, both log.
