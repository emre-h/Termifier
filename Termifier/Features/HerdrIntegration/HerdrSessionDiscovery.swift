// HerdrSessionDiscovery.swift
// Termifier
//
// Enumerates candidate herdr Unix-domain-socket locations and probes
// whether each is actually alive. A socket FILE surviving on disk does
// NOT mean a server is listening behind it -- a crashed herdr leaves
// the special file in place -- so liveness is ALWAYS a non-blocking
// BSD connect() probe, NEVER a bare stat()/fileExists() check.
// ECONNREFUSED (or any other connect failure) means dead.
//
// This is the first Swift-side Unix-domain-socket code in this
// codebase (TermifierMCPServer's own listener is AF_INET/loopback --
// there is no prior Unix-socket-client precedent anywhere else in
// this app).

///      `HerdrSessionCandidate`'s own doc comment) -- ALWAYS included,
///      even when `configRootDirectory` doesn't exist on disk.
///      `discover()` only constructs candidate PATHS; it never checks
///      existence itself (that would duplicate `isAlive`'s own job and
///      blur the two functions' separation of concerns) -- liveness
///      alone decides whether a candidate is ever surfaced to the user.
///   2. One candidate per existing subdirectory of
///      `<configRootDirectory>/sessions/` (`name:` the subdirectory's
///      own name, `socketPath:`
///      `<configRootDirectory>/sessions/<name>/herdr.sock`). Zero
///      candidates when `sessions/` doesn't exist. Non-directory
///      entries directly inside `sessions/` are skipped.
///   3. `environment["HERDR_SOCKET_PATH"]`, when present and
///      non-empty, as one more `name: nil` candidate alongside (not
///      instead of) the two sources above -- discovery's job is
///      finding every live session, and a replace-instead-of-add
///      semantics could hide real ones the directory scan already
///      found.
///
/// The union above is then deduped by `socketPath`, keeping the FIRST
/// occurrence in scan order (default candidate, then directory-scanned
/// named candidates, then the `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` override last):
/// `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` can legitimately coincide with either the
/// default candidate's own socket path or an already-discovered named
/// session's, and a later duplicate must never surface as a second row
/// for the same live session -- keeping the first occurrence also means
/// the default candidate's own `"default"` name, or a name from the
/// directory scan, is never overwritten by the override's own unnamed
/// (`nil`) shape.
///
/// `configRootDirectory` defaults to `~/.config/herdr` but is
/// injectable so tests never touch the real filesystem outside a
/// fixture temp directory (also never real system PATH-like defaults,
/// mirroring HerdrBinaryResolver's own reasoning).
