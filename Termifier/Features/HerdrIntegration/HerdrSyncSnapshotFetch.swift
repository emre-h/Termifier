// HerdrSyncSnapshotFetch.swift
// Termifier
//
// Bounded, SYNCHRONOUS `session.snapshot` fetch used ONLY by
// AppDelegate's herdr-restore path (HerdrRestoreTerminalIDResolver.swift)
// to resolve a herdr-bridged leaf's TERMINAL id at restore time -- see
// HerdrRestoreCommandPolicy.swift's own header for why a fresh, live
// lookup (never a value persisted in an earlier launch's sessions.json)
// is what keeps HerdrPaneRef's identity honest across a herdr restart:
// terminal ids are NOT stable across one, so a stale persisted value
// could silently build a bridge command aimed at a terminal that no
// longer exists (or, astronomically unlikely but not provably
// impossible, now belongs to something else entirely) -- resolving
// fresh here means an unresolvable pane simply has no map entry, which
// HerdrRestoreCommandPolicy.decide already has a home for
// (.plainShellAndPrune via a nil terminalID), rather than a silently
// wrong attach.
//
// Deliberately NOT the existing async HerdrOneShotRequest/
// BSDHerdrTransport pair (HerdrConnection.swift/HerdrTransport.swift):
// AppDelegate's own snapshot-restore call graph (restoreSession ->
// restoreWindow -> restoreTabSurfaces -> createSurfaceWithPwd) is, by
// design, a synchronous, bounded call chain rooted in
// `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, a fixed-signature, non-`async`
// NSApplicationDelegate callback -- and `restoreWindow`'s own "nothing
// restored yet -> the safety net creates a blank window"
// fallback (`AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching`, the
// `windowControllers.isEmpty` check right after `restoreSession()`)
// depends on restoration having ALREADY happened, synchronously, by the
// time that check runs -- making any part of this call graph `async`
// (awaited from a `Task`) would let that safety net's own check run
// concurrently with (on most schedules, BEFORE) restoration ever
// finishes, spuriously creating a second, blank window alongside the
// real restored one. Mirrors HerdrSessionDiscovery.isAlive(socketPath:)'s
// own identical choice, and for the same reason (that file's own
// header): a raw, bounded Darwin BSD-socket call, not `async`/`await`.
//
// Reuses HerdrConnectionWire's own requestLine/decodeResult and
// HerdrEmptyParams -- see HerdrConnection.swift -- so the wire ENVELOPE
// shape (the request line's own {"id":..,"method":..,"params":{}}
// shape; the response's own "result"/"error" probe) is defined in
// exactly one place, never duplicated. The connect phase is
// HerdrUnixSocket.connect (HerdrUnixSocket.swift); only the write/read
// loop below is new, hand-rolled Darwin BSD socket code, since isAlive
// never sends or reads anything -- it only confirms accept().
//
// TIMEOUTS: `connectTimeoutMilliseconds` (50ms) is IDENTICAL to
// HerdrSessionDiscovery.isAlive's own `probeTimeoutMilliseconds`, and
// for the identical reason (that type's own doc comment): a local
// AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM connect() resolves synchronously in practice, so
// this bound is a safety net for an EINPROGRESS that is not expected to
// ever actually happen, not a real budget. `readTimeoutMilliseconds`
// (500ms) bounds the write-then-read phase together as ONE hard
// monotonic deadline, enforced purely by a per-call poll(2) timeout on
// a socket kept non-blocking for its whole lifetime, never
// SO_SNDTIMEO/SO_RCVTIMEO. Measured: that socket option is an
// INACTIVITY timer restarted by every byte sent/received (man 2
// setsockopt), so a static value cannot bound a peer that trickles
// data forever. Also measured: once a peer has close()d, Darwin
// refuses setsockopt() on the still-open local end with EINVAL even
// though the peer's already-written bytes remain readable via
// recv(2), which would wrongly fail a fast peer that had already
// responded and closed. 500ms is a deliberately generous, unmeasured
// bound for that local round trip (a session.snapshot response is not
// expected to approach this on any real machine), chosen so a
// launch-time restore with herdr installed but genuinely unresponsive
// adds well under a second, never hangs indefinitely. This bounded
// timeout is exactly the "cannot resolve a terminal id for this ref"
// outcome HerdrRestoreCommandPolicy.decide already treats as
// .plainShellAndPrune -- not a new user-visible failure mode.
//
// SO_NOSIGPIPE (set by HerdrUnixSocket.connect): load-bearing, not
// decorative -- a write(2) to a peer that has already closed its end
// raises SIGPIPE on Darwin absent this option, which (uncaught)
// terminates the WHOLE host process, not just this one fetch.
