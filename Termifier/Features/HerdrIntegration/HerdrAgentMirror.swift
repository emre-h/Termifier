// HerdrAgentMirror.swift
// Termifier
//
// Translates herdr's own session state (a `HerdrSessionSnapshot`, or a
// pushed `HerdrEvent`) into `AgentRegistry` EXTERNAL entries -- the
// separate `externalEntries` store `AgentRegistry.swift` documents as
// "rows describing agents Termifier learned about from an external source
// (herdr's own event stream)". This type owns ONLY that store: it never
// reads or writes `AgentRegistry.entries` (the native hooks/
// titleHeuristic rows), matching `AgentRegistry.upsertExternalEntry` /
// `.removeExternalEntry`'s own "never touches entries" contract.
//
// `HerdrIntegrationCoordinator` (the herdr integration's lifecycle owner,
// HerdrIntegrationCoordinator.swift) is this type's main caller: it
// forwards every `session.snapshot()` result to
// `applySnapshot(_:socketPath:)`, every pushed `HerdrEvent` to
// `apply(event:socketPath:)`, and calls `connectionLost()` when its
// subscribed connection ends. This type itself never touches a
// transport/session/socket -- it is a pure state translator, which is
// exactly why it is injected into the coordinator as a concrete
// instance rather than needing its own transport-avoidance seam.
//
// The other entry point is `HerdrPaneBridgeObserver` conformance
// (HerdrPaneRegistry.swift): once wired via
// `paneRegistry.setBridgeObserver(mirror)`, `HerdrPaneRegistry` itself
// calls `herdrPaneBridgeDidChange(ref:)` directly, independent of any
// snapshot/event from the coordinator above -- see FOCUS SURFACE
// RESOLUTION below for what that callback does and why both mechanisms
// exist side by side.
//
// MAPPING RULES (frozen by this file's test suite):
//
//   - herdr `HerdrAgentStatus` -> Termifier `AgentState`: idle -> .idle,
//     working -> .working, blocked -> .blocked, done -> .done.
//     A record/event whose status is unknown/unrecognized never CREATES
//     a row. For an existing row, `agent == nil` paired with `.idle` or
//     `.unknown` means herdr no longer detects that CLI while the shell
//     pane remains, so the row becomes `.done`. An unknown status that
//     still carries an agent identity remains non-actionable and leaves
//     the row untouched.
//
//   - herdr `agent` kind string -> Termifier `AgentEntry.kind`: "claude" ->
//     `AgentEntry.claudeCodeKind` ("claude-code") -- the one measured
//     correspondence (herdr and Termifier name the same CLI differently).
//     Every other kind string passes through UNCHANGED:
//     `AgentEntry.displayName(forKind:)` already falls through to the
//     raw string for anything it doesn't recognize, so an unmapped kind
//     still renders sensibly rather than needing a decode error.
//
//   - Both `cwd` (on `HerdrAgentRecord`) and `agent` (on both
//     `HerdrAgentRecord` and `HerdrPaneAgentStatusChangedEvent`) are
//     OPTIONAL on the wire, and can legitimately go missing on a record/
//     event for a pane this file already has a row for (a snapshot's
//     `cwd` momentarily unavailable, or `mapKind(nil)`'s own claude-code
//     default -- see that function's doc comment). When UPDATING an
//     existing row, `applySnapshot` and `applyStatusChanged` therefore
//     fall back to the row's OWN previous `cwd`/`kind` rather than the
//     incoming (possibly nil/defaulted) value -- a nil `cwd` must never
//     blank out an already-known working directory, and a nil `agent`
//     must never silently relabel an already-known codex/opencode row as
//     Claude Code. It may still mark that preserved-kind row `.done` per
//     the absent-agent rule above. This only applies to updates: a brand-new row (no
//     previous value to fall back to) still gets `cwd: nil` / the
//     `mapKind(nil)` default exactly as documented above and below.
//
//   - `paneCreated` is a pure no-op for this file: a plain shell pane
//     has no agent (status "unknown"), so a bare "a pane now exists"
//     structural event carries no information this file acts on --
//     `HerdrIntegrationCoordinator` is what reacts to it (a pane-set
//     change that may require rebuilding the subscribed connection);
//     the authoritative status this file DOES act on always arrives
//     either via a full `session.snapshot()` (`applySnapshot`) or a
//     dedicated `paneAgentStatusChanged` event.
//
//   - `paneAgentStatusChanged` MAY create a new row (not just update an
//     existing one) when no row exists yet for that pane AND the event
//     carries a known (non-unknown) status: herdr's per-pane
//     `pane.agent_status_changed` subscription exists for every known
//     pane from the moment it is first subscribed (see
//     HerdrIntegrationCoordinator.swift), independent of whether that
//     pane had a detected agent YET -- the common case this covers is a
//     plain shell pane (no row, status "unknown" at snapshot time) that
//     later launches Claude Code: the very first sign of that is a
//     `paneAgentStatusChanged` event with no pre-existing row to
//     "update". A row created this way has `cwd: nil` (the event
//     carries no cwd field at all) -- a degraded-but-valid row, mirrors
//     this codebase's established "a degraded row beats no row"
//     precedent (e.g. `HerdrSessionInfo`'s own doc comment).
//
//   - `paneClosed(paneID:)`/`paneExited(paneID:)` each remove that
//     pane's external row IMMEDIATELY, rather than waiting for the next
//     `applySnapshot`'s own removal pass to notice its absence --
//     `HerdrIntegrationCoordinator` already rebuilds its connection on
//     either event, but the rebuilt connection's own fresh snapshot only
//     arrives once that new handshake completes, and the sidebar row
//     should disappear the moment herdr says the pane is gone, not after
//     that round trip. A harmless no-op when this instance never owned a
//     row for that pane id (e.g. a plain shell pane that closed without
//     ever reporting a known agent status) -- `AgentRegistry
//     .removeExternalEntry` on a missing id is itself already a no-op.
//
//   - `workspaceClosed(workspaceID:)` is a pure no-op here: this file
//     only ever removes a row by PANE id (`paneClosed`/`paneExited`
//     above), and herdr does NOT push `pane.closed` for a closed
//     workspace's own panes (the measured wire fact `workspaceClosed`
//     itself exists for) -- so any external row this file owns for that
//     workspace's panes is left in place until the next `applySnapshot`
//     naturally prunes it (this file's header, the paragraph on
//     `applySnapshot`'s own removal pass, below). `HerdrIntegrationCoordinator`
//     forwards this event to `HerdrTabCoordinator` only (its own
//     `HerdrStructureEventObserver.herdrWorkspaceClosed`), never to this
//     file.
//
//   - `unknown(eventType:)` (every herdr event type this codebase
//     doesn't decode strongly, PLUS any genuinely unrecognized type --
//     see HerdrEvent.swift's own header) is a pure no-op here.
//
//   - `focusSurfaceID` (FOCUS SURFACE RESOLUTION) is resolved fresh, at
//     every one of this file's five row-write sites, from
//     `paneRegistry.surfaceID(forPaneID:socketPath:)` for that row's own
//     pane: `nil` when the pane registry has no bridge entry for it
//     (true of every unbridged herdr pane), the registered surfaceID
//     when it does. Re-resolved EVERY time a write site runs, not only
//     on row creation, so a row written before its own pane was bridged
//     self-heals to a non-nil `focusSurfaceID` the next time that site
//     runs. Separately, `HerdrPaneBridgeObserver` conformance (this
//     file's header above) pushes the identical resolution into an
//     already-existing row the moment `HerdrPaneRegistry.register`/
//     `.unregister` changes that row's own pane's bridge state, with no
//     snapshot/event needed at all. The two mechanisms are deliberately
//     redundant: `herdrPaneBridgeDidChange` below never CREATES a row --
//     it only updates one that already exists (see its own doc comment)
//     -- so a pane bridged before herdr has connected and before this
//     file has ever written ANY row for it can only be picked up once
//     that row is first written, which is exactly what upsert-time
//     resolution does. The observer's own value is the complementary
//     case, for a row that already exists: it gives that row an
//     immediate `focusSurfaceID` refresh the moment the bridge changes,
//     without waiting on the next herdr snapshot/event to write that row
//     again. The observer callback only ever UPDATES a row that
//     already exists (matched by `HerdrStableID.make(socketPath:
//     paneID:)` from the changed `HerdrPaneRef`), only when
//     `focusSurfaceID` actually changes -- it never creates a row, and
//     never touches `lastEventAt` or `ownedIDsBySocketPath`.
//
//   - `applySnapshot(_:socketPath:)` also REMOVES any external entry
//     this instance previously created for `socketPath` that is no
//     longer present in the new snapshot's `agents[]` (by pane id, ANY
//     status -- an unknown-status record for an already-known pane
//     still counts as "present", so its row is updated or preserved by
//     the rules above rather than being pruned as "gone"). Ownership
//     is tracked PER socketPath so two independently-managed
//     connections (a future multi-session possibility) never prune each
//     other's rows.
//
// import order matches this codebase's other HerdrIntegration files
// (Foundation only -- no CryptoKit/Darwin needed here).
