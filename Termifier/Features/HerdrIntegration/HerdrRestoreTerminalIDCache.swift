// HerdrRestoreTerminalIDCache.swift
// Termifier
//
// Per-restore-pass memoization of the terminal ids
// AppDelegate.createSurfaceWithPwd needs for a herdr-bridged leaf
// (HerdrRestoreCommandPolicy.decide's terminalID parameter).
// HerdrRestoreTerminalIDResolver.resolve performs real socket I/O, so
// resolving once per socket path is preferable to once per leaf.
//
// A reference type, not a process-lifetime singleton: one instance is
// constructed at the root of a single restore pass
// (AppDelegate.restoreSession / recoverPreservedSession) and shared by
// every window and tab that pass restores, then discarded. Terminal ids
// are not stable across a herdr server restart, so nothing may persist
// this cache beyond one pass: a later, independent pass always gets a
// fresh instance and resolves fresh ids.
//
// An empty resolve result is memoized too: a dead socket must cost
// exactly one resolve attempt per pass, not one per leaf on that socket.
