// HerdrTransport.swift
// Termifier
//
// Abstract bidirectional line transport used by `HerdrOneShotRequest`
// and `HerdrEventStream` (HerdrConnection.swift) to talk to a herdr
// Unix-domain-socket server. Mirrors
// Termifier/Features/LSP/Transport/LSPTransport.swift's split between a
// protocol and an in-memory test double, with one deliberate
// difference: herdr's wire protocol is newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)
// -- one complete JSON value per line -- so this transport moves whole
// decoded-to-`String` LINES, not raw byte chunks. Splitting bytes on
// "\n" is this transport's own job (done below, inside whichever type
// implements `HerdrTransport`), not something `HerdrOneShotRequest`/
// `HerdrEventStream` or `HerdrEvent` need to know about.
//
// EOF vs error: stopping a herdr server makes recv() return zero bytes
// on a subscribed BSD socket -- a reliably observable, CLEAN
// disconnect, distinct from a genuine transport-level failure (a
// recv() errno, or -- in this test double -- an injected failure).
// `HerdrTransportEvent` keeps these as separate cases so a consumer
// (`HerdrOneShotRequest`/`HerdrEventStream`) can react differently: a
// pending request/subscribe ack must fail either way (there is no more
// result coming), but a long-lived, already-subscribed event stream
// treats EOF as a graceful, expected end of stream and an actual
// failure as something worth surfacing as an error -- see
// `HerdrEventStream.subscribe(_:socketPath:)`'s own doc comment
// (HerdrConnection.swift).
//
// `BSDHerdrTransport` below is the production implementation: a BSD
// Unix-domain socket driven by `DispatchSourceRead`, NOT `NWConnection`
// -- `NWConnection` does not reliably report a peer's graceful FIN via
// `stateUpdateHandler` when no `receive()` is outstanding (see
// `TermifierMCPServer.swift`'s own `armApprovalRequestConnectionDropSentinel`
// doc comment for the empirically-verified detail), whereas a raw
// recv() returning zero bytes is a simple, reliable EOF signal.
//
// `InMemoryHerdrTransport` above is what `HerdrConnectionTests`/
// `HerdrIntegrationCoordinatorTests` drive. `BSDHerdrTransport` below
// has its own real-socket integration tests in HerdrTransportTests.swift,
// which bind and listen on a local Unix-domain socket the test itself
// owns and controls both ends of -- the same fixture approach
// `HerdrSessionDiscovery.isAlive(socketPath:)`'s own tests
// (HerdrSessionDiscoveryTests.swift) already established. There is
// no "no real sockets in unit tests" rule anywhere in this codebase --
// a real, locally-bound-and-listening socket the test itself owns is
// exactly how socket-facing code IS tested here, for both this type and
// `HerdrSessionDiscovery`.
