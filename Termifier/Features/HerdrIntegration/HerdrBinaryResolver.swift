// HerdrBinaryResolver.swift
// Termifier
//
// Resolves the (optional, user-installed) `herdr` binary's absolute
// path. herdr integration is entirely detection-based: unlike
// termifier-session (a bundled app resource resolved by
// SessionBinaryResolver), herdr is a third-party CLI the user installs
// themselves (Homebrew, Cargo, ...), so resolution here needs an
// in-process PATH scan and a list of well-known install locations
// rather than a Bundle lookup.
//
// Resolution order: `TERMIFIER_HERDR_BIN` env override (non-empty) ->
// in-process PATH scan (FileManager.isExecutableFile, NEVER a
// subprocess -- a GUI app's launchd PATH frequently lacks
// Homebrew/Cargo) -> known absolute candidate paths, in order -> nil.
// Every tier is checked in this fixed priority order regardless of
// what earlier tiers contain; a `nil` result means herdr's UI must stay
// entirely absent -- Termifier behaves identically to today when herdr
// isn't installed.

/// may not exist on the machine running the test suite -- especially
/// once a manual smoke test `brew install`s herdr onto
/// this same development machine).
///
/// A FOUND path is memoized for the rest of this *instance's* lifetime
/// -- resolution walks PATH plus several known directories doing real
/// filesystem stats, and callers such as availability polling may
/// invoke `resolve()` repeatedly, so a resolver that already knows
/// herdr's path shouldn't re-scan on every call. A MISS, in contrast,
/// is never cached: herdr may be installed (`brew install herdr` or
/// similar) after Termifier has already probed and found nothing, and the
/// scan itself is cheap (a handful of `isExecutableFile` checks), so
/// caching a miss would permanently hide a herdr installed after
/// launch until the next app restart. The cache lives behind
/// `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` (mirrors `FSEventsEventSource`'s own
/// lock-protected-state idiom in `FileSyncManager.swift`) so a `let`
/// stored property can still be mutated from this non-`mutating`
/// method without a data race, and so this type keeps its synthesized
/// `Sendable` conformance -- no `@unchecked Sendable` needed anywhere.
/// The cache is a per-instance field (not `static`/type-global), so
/// distinct `HerdrBinaryResolver` instances constructed with distinct
/// `environment` values (as every test in this suite does) always
/// resolve independently.
