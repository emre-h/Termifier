// HerdrSocketWatchRoots.swift
// Termifier
//
// The set of directories a herdr-socket watcher must observe, extracted
// as a pure decision in the same shape as
// `HerdrHeuristicIngestionPolicy`: every filesystem question this needs
// answered (does a directory exist, what are its subdirectories) is
// supplied by the caller as a closure, so the decision itself never
// touches disk and is testable without any fixture.
//
// A herdr socket can appear at `<configRoot>/herdr.sock`, at
// `<configRoot>/sessions/<name>/herdr.sock`, or at whatever
// `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` names -- see `HerdrSessionDiscovery.discover()`
// for the candidate set these roots must be able to reveal.
