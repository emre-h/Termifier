// fetches the daemon's full session ledger
// (`SessionDaemonClient.listAll()`), keeps only its Running sessions
// (an Exited entry has no affordances here -- nothing to attach to,
// nothing to reconnect -- and the daemon ledger's own GC handles its
// eventual removal, so the browser is a view of attachable/killable
// sessions, not the raw ledger), flags orphaned running sessions
// (a session with no live ghostty surface attached in this Termifier
// process — `SessionSurfaceMap` has no entry for it), and exposes
// attach/kill actions. Kept separate from
// `SessionBrowserWindowController` (AppKit/SwiftUI chrome) so it's
// directly unit-testable — no window, no real daemon process — the
