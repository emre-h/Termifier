// ApprovalHookEvent.swift
// Termifier
//
// Single source of truth for the hook event Termifier's synchronous approval
// entry fires under: ClaudeHooksConfigManager and CodexHooksConfigManager
// both install their approval command entry keyed to this event name,
// GrokHooksConfigManager keys Grok's entry to that CLI's own blocking
// event instead, TermifierMCPServer.routeApprovalRequest gates the approval
// endpoint on an incoming request naming the event its kind's gate fires
// under, and AgentHookPermissionResponse echoes the PermissionRequest
// name back in its own response body's hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName.
// All of them must agree, or a future rename that updates the installers
// without updating the gate (or vice versa) leaves every new install's
// approval banner silently inert -- see TermifierMCPServer.routeApprovalRequest's
// own doc comment for exactly that failure mode during the PreToolUse ->
// PermissionRequest migration this type was introduced for. Mirrors
// ApprovalHookTiming's own "one file, one cross-layer contract fact"
// precedent.
//
// It also owns the one permission-mode fact the approval route branches
// on: which mode leaves Termifier's gate as the only approval mechanism
// behind a call (gateIsSoleAuthority), since for Grok that is what
// decides whether a banner belongs to Termifier or to Grok's own pane.
