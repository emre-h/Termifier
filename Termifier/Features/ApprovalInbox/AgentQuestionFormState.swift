// AgentQuestionFormState.swift
// Termifier
//
// The AskUserQuestion form's own state machine, extracted out of the
// view so it is testable without SwiftUI: which question of a
// multi-question AgentQuestionPrompt is currently displayed, the
// in-progress selection for it, and every answer already collected for
// an earlier question. AgentQuestionBannerView owns exactly one of
// these (as @State) and contains no answer-building or eligibility
// logic of its own -- every rule (what counts as a valid selection,
// what an option click or a confirm does, which option's preview shows)
// lives here.
//
// A value type, not a class: SwiftUI's @State re-renders on assignment,
// and Equatable lets a test assert the whole state after one action
// without hand-picking fields.
