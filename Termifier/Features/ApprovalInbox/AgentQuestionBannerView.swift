// AgentQuestionBannerView.swift
// Termifier
//
// The approval banner's `.agentQuestion` mode (Claude Code's
// AskUserQuestion, see `ApprovalRequest.Source`): renders the WHOLE
// two-column notification row for this source -- `ApprovalBannerView`
// only supplies its own `headerRow` (the tool/target label + queue
// navigator, identical across every source) as `header`, everything
// else is this view's own.
//
// This view owns `@State private var form: AgentQuestionFormState` and
// `@FocusState`, so unlike `.agentHook`'s primary button/menu items
// (`ApprovalBannerView.agentHookPrimaryButton`/`agentHookMenuItems(
// toolName:offers:)`, plain computed properties/functions `ApprovalBannerView`
// itself owns) this view CANNOT expose `primaryButton`/`menuItems` as
// computed properties for `ApprovalBannerView` to read: accessing a `@State`
// property outside of SwiftUI's own render pass for the view that owns
// it reads back only that property's `State(initialValue:)`, never the
// persisted value from a prior interaction -- concretely, calling
// `AgentQuestionBannerView(...).menuItems` from a DIFFERENT view's
// `body` would always show the pristine first-question state, and any
// action captured inside would write to a `State` location SwiftUI
// never installed. This view's own `body`, rendering its own leading
// column AND its own `ApprovalActionColumn`, is the only place `form`/
// `focusedField` may be read.
//
// Left column: `header`, the current question's own header chip (if
// any) + "i / n" position (only while more than one question is queued
// in THIS prompt -- distinct from `ApprovalBannerView`'s own queue
// navigator "N / M", which browses every pending request queued for
// this WINDOW, not the questions within this one prompt) + a
// tap-to-expand, hover-to-tooltip question text (`ExpandableBodyText`, shared with
// `ApprovalBannerView`'s own tool/hook payload), then source-specific
// extras:
// the inline option-list layout (plus a side-by-side markdown preview
// box when any option carries a `preview`) for a multi-select question
// or one with any preview -- AskUserQuestion's own schema for the
// preview case ("when any option has a preview, the UI switches to a
// side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and the
// preview on the right"), extended to every multi-select question too,
// since toggling never submits on its own and its rows must stay
// reachable without reopening the menu per click -- else the standing
// free-text field whenever `form.showsFreeTextField` (a zero-option
// question, or "Other…" chosen from the Options menu), then the "Add
// notes" field once revealed. A request whose prompt wants this inline
// layout for any of its questions gets the wide floating panel instead
// of the default notification width (`ApprovalRequest.
// prefersWideApprovalPanel`, `ApprovalPanelArranger.wideWidth`).
//
// Right column (`ApprovalActionColumn`): "Next"/"Answer" only while a
// confirm step is needed (a multi-select question, or a visible
// free-text field -- a plain single-select click on a listed option
// confirms immediately, see `handleOptionClick`), disabled until
// `form.canConfirm`. For a single-select question with no previews, the
// Options menu lists each listed option (`optionMenuItem(index:option:)`,
// a `Button` that confirms immediately) plus "Other…", then "Add
// notes"/"Back"/"Chat about this". For a multi-select question or one
// with any preview, the options themselves -- AND the standing "Other"
// choice -- stay in the inline layout instead (a hover-driven preview
// has no menu equivalent, a multi-select row must stay reachable
// without reopening the menu per click, and the inline "Other" row
// mirrors the CLI's own list layout), so the menu holds only "Add
// notes"/"Back"/"Chat about this", no "Other…" of its own. Choice rows
// share `ChoiceRowStyle` with the inline layout's own option rows.
//
// `ApprovalBannerView` gives this view `.id(request.id)`, so a
// different request tears this whole view (and its `form`) down and
// creates a fresh one -- there is no `.onChange(of:)` reset here. The
// same teardown covers every OTHER removal cause too (hold-window
// expiry via `ApprovalHookTiming`, `ApprovalInboxStore.
// expireForSurface` when the target pane closes, `expireAll`, or the
// long-poll awaiter's own cancellation all clear `ApprovalBannerModel.
// current`, which removes this view from the hierarchy the same way),
// so this view's own ROOT-level `.onDisappear` is the ONE mechanism
// that ever needs to restore terminal focus -- not either text field's
// own `.onDisappear`, which also fires mid-prompt whenever the form
// advances past a question answered via "Other" while this view stays
// on screen. Both the free-text field and the notes field can hold
// first responder, and the root `.onDisappear` restores terminal focus
// for either. See `textFieldWasFocused`'s own doc comment.
//
// Neither text field is ever made first responder by this code (see
// RecoveryBarView's own header comment for why no bar/banner control
// here ever calls `makeFirstResponder` itself) -- `@FocusState` only
// OBSERVES whether the user's own click gave either field focus.
