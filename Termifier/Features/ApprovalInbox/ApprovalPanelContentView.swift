// ApprovalPanelContentView.swift
// Termifier
//
// SwiftUI content of the floating `ApprovalPanelWindow`: hosts
// `ApprovalBannerView` inside a vertically scrolling, width-clamped
// glass container, independent of `MainContentView`'s own
// `safeAreaInset`.
//
// Reads `model.current` directly in `body` (not threaded in as a
// parameter): `selectNext()`/`selectPrevious()` mutate
// `ApprovalBannerModel`'s `@Observable` state without posting an
// explicit change notification, relying on whichever view reads
// `current` inside its own `body` to re-render (see `selectNext()`'s own
// doc comment in ApprovalBannerModel.swift) -- this view is that reader.
//
// The root shape -- `ScrollView` clamped to `layout.heightCap +
// 2*gutter`, `.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` before
// `.frame(width: layout.width + 2*gutter)` -- now spans the SHEET plus
// `ApprovalPanelArranger.gutter` on EVERY axis, UNIFORMLY (see the
// dismiss-button paragraph below for why the gutter has to live INSIDE
// the `ScrollView` at all, and `ApprovalPanelWindow`'s own header for why
// the gutter is uniform rather than top/left-only now). The
// `onGeometryChange` that reports content height to
// `onContentSizeChange` stays attached to `glassWrapped(request:)`
// itself, the pre-padding, pre-gutter node, so it still reports the
// SHEET's own size for the displayed request (`layout.width`, one of
// `ApprovalPanelArranger.fixedWidth`/`wideWidth`, never measured from
// content itself, see `ApprovalPanelArranger.panelWidth(for:
// visibleFrame:)`), matching what
// `ApprovalPanelController.measureFrame(hostingController:)` expects
// back through `applyContentHeight(_:)`; the `gutter` padding (all four
// sides) is applied AFTER that node, inside the `ScrollView`, so
// `NSHostingController.sizeThatFits(in:)` -- which measures the WHOLE
// content view -- still sees the same gutter-inflated total it always
// did, just assembled inside the `ScrollView` now instead of outside it.
//
// The dismiss button (`dismissButton`, `isPanelHovered`) lives HERE, not
// on `ApprovalBannerView`'s own root, but it is applied as an
// `.overlay` INSIDE `glassWrapped(request:)`'s own `GlassEffectContainer`
// (on `ApprovalBannerView` itself, before `.id(request.id)`) -- see the
// z-order paragraph below for why it has to sit there rather than
// outside the container. A `ScrollView` clips its content to its own
// bounds, so the gutter the × straddles into must be PART of that
// content, not outside it: the `ScrollView`'s own frame is therefore
// widened by `gutter` on every axis (above), and `glassWrapped(request:)`'s
// own `gutter` padding (all four sides, applied at the call site in
// `body`) centers the sheet -- × included, since it travels with it as
// an overlay -- inside that widened frame, leaving exactly `gutter` of
// transparent, still-in-bounds space on every side. All four gutters
// stay unpainted (`ApprovalPanelWindow` is non-opaque, so the window
// server routes a click there to whatever window sits behind the panel,
// not the panel itself) -- the top and left ones also give the dismiss
// disc room to straddle the sheet's own top-left corner without getting
// clipped.
//
// Z-order: a view's Liquid Glass content -- anything placed INSIDE a
// `GlassEffectContainer`'s own content closure -- composites ABOVE that
// container's glass background; a view placed OUTSIDE the container (a
// sibling `.overlay` on the container itself, even a later, "higher" one
// in SwiftUI's own declaration order) composites BENEATH it instead
// (confirmed by screenshot across two failed attempts: field-verified,
// not a documentation inference -- an `.overlay` on the container drew
// only the sliver of the × outside the sheet's own corner, and a plain-
// color disc in that same position drew nothing at all). The × is
// therefore inside `glassWrapped(request:)`'s `GlassEffectContainer`
// content, alongside `ApprovalBannerView`, not on the `ScrollView`
// around it. It is drawn with PLAIN colors (`Circle().fill(...)`/
// `.strokeBorder(...)`), not `.glassEffect`/`.thinMaterial`/any other
// backdrop-based fill, so it does not blend with the container's own
// glass background the way a second glass shape sharing that container
// would.
//
// `ApprovalPanelWindow` is non-opaque with a `.clear` background, so the
// window server delivers mouse events only over painted pixels -- the
// gutter itself is unpainted (transparent) except for the × once shown,
// so hover tracking cannot be attached to the padded root (see
// `isPanelHovered`'s own doc comment for the two regions actually
// tracked, and why).
//
// Glass: the panel uses the same untinted regular glass as macOS
// notification banners, independent of the Termifier theme -- a `Color.clear`
// `.glassEffect(.regular, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 20))` behind the
// content. The `reduceTransparency` path fills the same rounded rect with
// `.windowBackgroundColor` instead. No theme-color tint, no atmosphere
// layer, no inactive-window dimming: unlike the main window, this panel
// never reads the Termifier theme at all.
//
// Rim: `ApprovalPanelWindow.hasShadow` is `false` (see that file's own
// header for why) and this sheet draws no shadow of its own either -- a
// drawn shadow would paint pixels into the transparent gutter, and
// `ApprovalPanelWindow` routes a click by pixel alpha, so a painted
// gutter would capture a click meant for whatever window sits behind
// the panel instead of passing it through. The sheet draws only its OWN
// 1pt rim -- a `strokeBorder` on TOP of the glass fill, at the SAME 20pt
// corner radius as the glass shape -- so it still reads as a distinct
// surface without the system shadow's own outline. The
// `reduceTransparency` path keeps the same rim on top of its solid fill.
// `.rect(cornerRadius: 20)`/`RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)` is
// therefore the panel's entire visible outline in every appearance and
// every `reduceTransparency` state alike -- `ApprovalPanelWindow` itself
// carries no shadow or outline of its own at all.
