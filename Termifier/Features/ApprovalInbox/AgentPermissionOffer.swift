// AgentPermissionOffer.swift
// Termifier
//
// One entry of Claude Code's PermissionRequest hook payload's top-level
// `permission_suggestions` array (hooks.md), a sibling of `tool_input`
// rather than a key inside it: "the always-allow choices
// the CLI's own dialog itself offers." Decoded by `AgentHookToolCall`
// into `permissionOffers`, rendered by `ApprovalBannerView.
// agentHookMenuItems(toolName:offers:)` as one choice row per offer, and
// echoed back through `ApprovalDecision.
// allowedWithPermissions(_:)` -> `AgentHookPermissionResponse` exactly
// as received -- accepting one is documented to behave the same as
// picking that same choice in the CLI's own dialog.
//
// `label(for:)` is the ONLY place that turns a raw suggestion entry into
// the string a button shows -- derived from the entry's own structured
// fields (`type`/`rules`/`directories`/`mode`/`destination`), never from
// the CLI's own dialog strings or implementation. Kept a pure function,
// independent of `AgentHookToolCall.decode`'s own kind-gated
// `acceptsPermissionUpdates(kind:)` check, so it is directly unit-testable.
// Returns `nil` for an entry with nothing to offer -- see its own doc
// comment for the full contract -- which `AgentHookToolCall.
// decodePermissionOffers` treats as a per-element drop, mirroring Claude
// Code's own dialog intake, which shows no row for a suggestion whose
// label would render empty.
