// AgentQuestionPrompt.swift
// Termifier
//
// Decoded form of Claude Code's AskUserQuestion tool_input.questions
// array -- populated by AgentHookToolCall.decode(from:kind:) only for a
// claude-code AskUserQuestion call (see that method's own doc comment),
// and rendered by the approval banner (AgentQuestionBannerView, driven
// by AgentQuestionFormState) as this question's own options (through the
// Options pull-down, or an inline list for a multi-select or
// preview-carrying question, see Question.wantsInlineOptionList) instead
// of a Deny/Always Allow/Allow row. AgentQuestionAnswers is the human's
// response, free of
// any wire encoding -- threaded back through ApprovalDecision.answered(_:)
// into AgentHookPermissionResponse.encodeAnswered, the ONE place that
// knows how Claude Code's own hook wants each answer spelled (see that
// method's own doc comment).
