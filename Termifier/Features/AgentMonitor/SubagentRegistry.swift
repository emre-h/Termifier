// SubagentRegistry.swift
// Termifier
//
// Storage for the child rows a CLI's subagent hook events report,
// separate from AgentRegistry.entries -- a child never becomes a row of
// its own (AgentEntry.id == surfaceID is the "one pane, one row"
// foundation; see .claude/architecture.md section 5). Children live only
// as long as the CLI reports them: no timer, no retention count, no
// eviction policy.
//
// Row-state decisions stay in AgentStateResolver, and so does a child's
// LIFETIME: this type never inspects a non-subagent event's name and
// never compares sessionIDs itself. AgentStateResolver.resolveHook
// decides whether a parent-scoped SessionEnd/SessionStart, or a row
// replacement where a different session takes the row over, retires
// every child of the surface (AgentResolution.retiresChildren) -- a
// same-session parent Stop no longer does, since a CLI can and does keep
// a subagent running past its parent's own turn ending -- and
// AgentRegistry.apply carries that decision out by
// calling handleSurfaceDestroyed below -- the same call site an actual
// row removal or .done settle already uses. This type reuses
// AgentStateResolver.resultingState(for:) for a child's own state so no
// child-specific vocabulary is ever duplicated -- the same table decides
// what a hook event means for a parent row and for a child row.
