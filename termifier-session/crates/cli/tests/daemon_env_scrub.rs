//! Regression test for the daemon inheriting its whole process
//! environment from whichever client first spawned it, then handing
//! that environment down to every session shell it spawns for the
//! rest of its life, across Termifier restarts. Confirmed on a real
//! machine: a long-running daemon held `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR`
//! pointing into a stale DerivedData debug build while the installed
//! app had long since moved to `/Applications`.
//!
//! `POISONED_ENV` intentionally mirrors `SCRUBBED_ENV_VARS`
//! (`crates/cli/src/commands/daemon.rs`): this file's job is to prove
//! the scrub mechanism works end to end through a real subprocess
//! (the actual `env::remove_var` loop, the actual daemon-to-session
//! inheritance chain, `new`'s actual empty `SessionSpec.env`), which
//! no unit test can exercise. Whether `SCRUBBED_ENV_VARS` is itself
//! complete, meaning it covers every key `resolve_shell_integration_env`
//! can push, is pinned separately by `daemon.rs`'s own
//! `scrubbed_env_vars_covers_every_key_resolve_shell_integration_env_can_push`
//! unit test, which calls that function directly. Only a same-crate
//! unit test can do that: `crates/cli` has no library target, so this
//! external, subprocess-based integration test has no way to call
//! into `cli`'s own internals at all.
//!
//! `crates/daemon/src/session.rs`'s `spawn_session` already removes
//! `TERMIFIER_SURFACE_ID` at the per-spawn site (`cmd.env_remove(...)`,
//! covering the case where the daemon's own inherited copy is stale
//! because a session can be reattached to a different pane), so this
//! test's assertion for that one variable is a non-regression check,
//! not new coverage. For the other variables poisoned below, the
//! scrub in `commands::daemon::run` (`SCRUBBED_ENV_VARS`) is the only
//! thing standing between them and a spawned session's shell, which
//! is exactly what this test exercises end to end.
//!
//! `common::ScratchDaemon` (crates/daemon/tests/common/mod.rs) cannot
//! exercise this: it runs `Daemon::bind` on a thread of the test
//! process itself, so "the daemon's environment" would just be the
//! test binary's own environment. This spawns the real
//! `termifier-session daemon --foreground` binary instead, with specific
//! variables overridden on that child process, so the daemon's own
//! process environment and this test process's environment are
//! genuinely separate address spaces.
//!
//! `termifier-session new`'s `SessionSpec.env` (see
//! `commands::new::build_spec`) carries `resolve_terminal_env`, read
//! from the `new` invocation's own client process, not the daemon's:
//! `TERM`/`TERMINFO`/`LANG`/`PATH`/etc reach the session shell from
//! whichever process ran `termifier-session new`, overriding whatever the
//! daemon itself happened to inherit for those same keys. Every other
//! variable this test poisons is either scrubbed (`POISONED_ENV`) or,
//! for keys `resolve_terminal_env` never touches, falls through
//! unchanged from the daemon's own inherited environment, which is
//! exactly the leak path this test proves is closed for THOSE keys.
//! This test's one session is also created with no `--argv` at all, so
//! `spec.argv` is `None` and `session.rs` must resolve the executable
//! to run from `$SHELL` itself: `SHELL` is pointed at an executable
//! dumper script (`write_dumper_shell`) rather than a nonexistent
//! path, so this genuinely exercises that default-argv resolution
//! instead of only proving `SHELL` is inherited (an explicit `--argv`
//! session would prove just the latter, since `session.rs` never reads
//! `$SHELL` once `spec.argv` is `Some`). On macOS that default-argv
//! path now runs the dumper through a real `login(1)` session, which
//! overwrites the `SHELL` variable the dumper itself observes with the
//! current account's passwd-entry shell; `dumper_shell_path` still
//! decides what `login`'s `exec -l` ultimately execs, so the dumper
//! still runs and still writes its dump, but its own `$SHELL` no
//! longer equals `dumper_shell_path` on that platform.
//!
//! `TERMINFO` is forwarded by `resolve_terminal_env`, so this test sets
//! it explicitly on the `new` invocation itself (`CLIENT_TERMINFO`,
//! distinct from the daemon's own poisoned copy, `KNOWN_TERMINFO`) and
//! asserts the session shell sees the client's value, not the
//! daemon's: proof the client-supplied copy actually reaches the
//! shell rather than merely not crashing. `GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR` and
//! `XDG_DATA_DIRS` are deliberately absent from both `POISONED_ENV` and
//! `resolve_terminal_env`'s own key list, so this test asserts the
//! daemon-inheritance fall-through for both instead: they DO survive
//! into the session shell with the exact value set on the daemon.
//! `GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR` survives for one reason: nothing on any path a
//! session shell can take ever re-supplies it, so scrubbing it would
//! be a pure loss, not a fix, even though the daemon's own inherited
//! copy can go stale.
//! `XDG_DATA_DIRS` survives for a different reason: its inherited copy
//! carries the user's own real entries alongside whatever Termifier or
//! ghostty appended, not just a stale pointer with nothing else riding
//! along.
